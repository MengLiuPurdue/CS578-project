# CS578-project
The code can be run from the following three files:
1. single_para_tuning.m
2. grid_search.m
3. final_test.m
4. sensitivity.m
You can get all experiments results by simply running these four files. But the whole experiment will take hours to finish. Each file will contain experiments for multiple algorithms. I have separated them through comments. You can run a specific algorithm by simply commenting the others. But the whole process on even one algorithm might also be very time consuming. You can reduce the running time by changing the “data_num” variable. It shows up at the first few lines.

The external libraries I use in this project is “RankLib-2.7.jar”. It has already been included in the sources folder. And the source code for that library is in the folder “RankLib”.

All source code and dataset files should be in the same folder to make the experiments run successfully.
